\section{Offshoring in literature}
Offshoring has been widely studied in the past decades. There are two major branches of research: the first describes reality through statistics or case studies (e.g. \cite{Rottman.2008}, \cite{Pedersen.2013} )

\subsection{Definition and Terms}
In existing literature, there is no single definition of the term offshoring nor a precise delimitation to the term outsourcing. Both apply to organizational decisions in companies. 

According to \cite[pp. 1f]{Specht.2007}, outsourcing is buying services from other companies. Offshoring is defined as a special form of outsourcing, in which the service is bought from a foreign company. \cite[p. 2]{Alebrand.2013} defines outsourcing and offshoring as mutually exclusive: outsourcing is the provision of services by external companies, offshoring is the internal execution of tasks in a foreign country.

These contrasting definitions may serve as an example for the lack of distinct terms in this field of research. Nevertheless all the definitions agree that outsourcing pertains to external service provision and offshoring refers to service provision in a foreign country. This synopsis as well as the planned Bachelor's thesis will use the following definition of the term offshoring by \cite[p. 321]{Andersson.2016}:

%\begin{quote}
%	``Offshoring [is the] disintegration of the firmsâ€™ production processes across national borders[...]''
%\end{quote} 

Therefore, the terms offshoring and outsourcing do not have a direct relation; both terms are independent and describe different possibilities of entrepreneurial organization. In figure \ref{fig:DefTerms}, the delimitation between outsourcing and offshoring is clearly shown.
